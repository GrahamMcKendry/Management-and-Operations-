## Overview 

Systems Administration processes focus on the daily, weekly, monthly and as-needed tasks that are required for maintaining and supporting any running environment. Proper systems administration helps ensure the platform will remain stable and reliable, in turn helping business units to remain confidence in the Service and in IT. 

 

### The Modern Approach 

Cloud management platforms (CMP) provide management capabilities of public, private and hybrid cloud environments. Scenarios include scheduling, monitor and performing needed operational tasks in an automated, repeatable, reportable and controlled manner. CMP also provides governance and approval mechanisms for management oversight. BizDevOps teams will only use release management tooling (e.g. TFS/VSTS) to target deployment of services on multiple cloud environments.
