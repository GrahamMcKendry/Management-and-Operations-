Use the procedure described in this section to establish and maintain a Cybersecurity Major Incident Response Plan (CS-MIRP) for Azure. Once this capability is in place, your organization will have a readily accessible and up-to-date playbook detailing the key stakeholders, communication steps, and support logistics with Microsoft in the event of a critical cybersecurity incident related to your Azure services. 

 

## Preparation 

Perform the following activities before you being the CS-MIRP authoring process: 

 
### Premier customers 

Ask your Microsoft Technical Account Manager to schedule the CS-MIRP creation activity with you 
Ensure all appropriate stakeholders will be available for CS-MIRP creation activity 
Work with your Microsoft Technical Account Manager to ensure appropriate stakeholders are set up to log Support Requests through the Azure Portal  

### Non-Premier customers 

Request the CS-MIRP template from your Microsoft account team 

 
## Procedure - How to Create a Cybersecurity Major Incident Response Plan 

Use this procedure to create the CS-MIRP document. 

 

Premier customers should simply work with their Microsoft Technical Account Manager through the activity - i.e. no need to manually go through the info below. 

 

1. Complete the 'Roles and Responsibilities' section 

<TODO - Do we manually list all the fields, or simply include the CS-MIRP template as an attachment or external link?> 

 

2. Complete the 'Tenant/Subscription Key Information' section 

**TODO - Do we manually list all the fields, or simply include the CS-MIRP template as an attachment or external link?** 

 

3. Complete the 'How to Open a Service Request' section 

**TODO - Do we manually list all the fields, or simply include the CS-MIRP template as an attachment or external link?**

 

4. Complete the 'Template/Workflow' section 

**TODO - Do we manually list all the fields, or simply include the CS-MIRP template as an attachment or external link?**

 

5. Store/communicate CS-MIRP document 

- Store the completed CS-MIRP document in a formal and accessible internal location 
- Review the CS-MIRP document with all affected stakeholders 

 

## Next Steps 

None specific to this section 

- For full details regarding Azure Security incident response, refer to http://aka.ms/SecurityResponsepaper . This is considered a must-read document for all customer stakeholders that may be involved in the response process for security-related incidents involving Azure, including IT security, networking, platforms engineering, and service desk management. 

- The security incident response process should be covered as part of your Major Incident Response Plan (MIRP) in terms of stakeholder information & communication preferences. Microsoft recommends to create a separate section of the MIRP - called a Cybersecurity Major Incident Response Plan (CS-MIRP) - to cover the MIRP elements for security incident processing. 

 
*NOTE: Communications during security incidents should be on a strict need-to-know basis.* 

 

### Premier Customers 

If you suspect or confirm a security incident that appears to relate to your Azure services: 

1. Immediately log a Severity-A Premier Support case by phone (Refer to https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/premier/contacts for your local number) 
2. Provide your Premier Access ID (contact your Microsoft TAM if you don't know your Access ID) 
3. Provide a description of the issue, noting that it is potentially a security incident 

 
*NOTE: Not all such support cases will ultimately be deemed by Microsoft as a security incident. If Microsoft deems a particular case to be a security incident, the security incident management process will be pursued. Premier customers have Microsoft on retainer for Security Incident Response.* 

If not already done so, discuss with your Microsoft Technical Account Manager to ensure a clear understanding of the security incident management process for Premier customers. 

 
## Overview 

Security-related incidents are a subset of the Major Incident category, although are typically considered as their own category of incident due to the highly sensitive nature of their details and impact. Only a subset of security-themed scenarios are considered Security Incidents. Microsoft defines a security incident in the Online Services as illegal or unauthorized access that results in the loss, disclosure or alteration of Customer Data. Examples illustrating the difference between security incidents and non-security incidents are as follows:
