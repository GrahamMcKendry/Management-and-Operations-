Use the procedure described in this section to establish and maintain a Major Incident Response Plan (MIRP) for Azure. Once this capability is in place, your organization will have a readily accessible and up-to-date playbook detailing the key stakeholders, communication steps, and support logistics with Microsoft in the event of a business-critical incident related to your Azure services. 

 

## Preparation 

Perform the following activities before you being the Major Incident Response Plan authoring process: 

 

Premier customers 

Ask your Microsoft Technical Account Manager to schedule the MIRP creation activity with you 

Ensure all appropriate stakeholders will be available for MIRP creation activity 

Work with your Microsoft Technical Account Manager to ensure appropriate stakeholders are set up to log Support Requests through the Azure Portal 

Non-Premier customers 

Request the MIRP template from your Microsoft account team 

 

## Procedure - How to Create a Major Incident Response Plan 

Use this procedure to create the Major Incident Response Plan document. 

 

Premier customers should simply work with their Microsoft Technical Account Manager through the activity - i.e. no need to manually go through the info below. 

 

1. Complete the 'Roles and Responsibilities' section 

<TODO - Do we manually list all the fields, or simply include the MIRP template as an attachment or external link?> 

 

2. Complete the 'Tenant/Subscription Key Information' section 

<TODO - Do we manually list all the fields, or simply include the MIRP template as an attachment or external link?> 

 

3. Complete the 'How to Open a Service Request' section 

<TODO - Do we manually list all the fields, or simply include the MIRP template as an attachment or external link?> 

 

4. Complete the 'Template/Workflow' section 

<TODO - Do we manually list all the fields, or simply include the MIRP template as an attachment or external link?> 

 

5. Store/communicate MIRP document 

Store the completed MIRP document in a formal and accessible internal location 

Review the MIRP document with all affected stakeholders 

 

## Next Steps 

After you create the Major Incident Response Plan, proceed to conduct the same exercise for the Cybersecurity Major Incident Response Plan: Security Incident Response Plan 

## Overview 

A Major Incident is a service incident with disastrous impact (either existing or potential), for example: 

 
- Significant financial loss 
- Regulatory non-compliance 
- Legal ramifications 
- Physical harm 
- Brand/reputational damage 
 

NOTE: Security incidents are categorized separately, and covered in the 'Security Incident Management' section. 
 

### The Major Incident Process 

The primary inputs & outputs of the Major Incident process are depicted as follows (emphasizing the importance of maintaining visibility into the health of your applications and Azure subscriptions): 


![MajorIncident](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Management-and-Operations-/blob/master/_images/MajorIncidentFlow.PNG)

At the time of a major incident, two of the most important elements to focus on are: 

Fast resolution of incident (Time-to-Restore) 

Communication of impact and expected duration to stakeholders 

NOTE: This requires that you have an established communication plan, and ideally that you measure your communication effectiveness 

 

Key metrics to capture per major incident ("MI") include: 

| __Metric__ | __Definition__ |__Why__ | 
|------------------------------|----------------------------|------------------|
| Time to Detect (TTD)   | Time from the incident inception to detection   | TTD is critical to customer satisfaction and TTR   | 
| Time to Communicate (TTC)   | Time from detection until the incident is communicated to stakeholders   | TTC is critical to customer satisfaction and Ops efficiency   | 
| Time to Restore (TTR)   | Time to restore the MI    | TTR is the other half of availability    | 
| Bridge Duration  | Average minutes for the bridge    | Long bridges hurt TTR, impact morale, cost resources, distract from other work   | 
| Customer calls due to MI    | Calls due to the MI   | Calls to Support imply end user impact as well as quality measure of TTD and TTC    | 
| # people paged per MI   | Number of people that were paged because of the MI    | Paging people hurts morale (attrition), costs resources, distracts from other work and is a measure of readiness with monitoring (targeted escalations)    | 
| # people on bridge per MI   | How many people were on the Bridge    | Big bridges impact morale (attrition), cost resources, distract from other work, and imply readiness    | 
| Approximate Bridge Minutes (bridge duration x people on bridge)    | Row 4 x Row 7   | Visual indicator of a cost factor for bridges for the service for the month (as each person-minute is expensive and should motivate improvements)   | 

### Major Incident Response Plan (MIRP) 

The Major Incident Response Plan (MIRP) is a working document - essentially a playbook - detailing the plan of action in the event the customer experiences a major issue with an Azure service. The MIRP is typically a Word document that defines the process between the customer and Microsoft. For Microsoft Premier customers, the MIRP document is co-owned by the customer and the Microsoft Technical Account Manager. 

Completion of the MIRP document - and it's immediate access by stakeholders - ensures all stakeholders, customer and Microsoft, are clear about their respective roles and responsibilities, clear on expectations in terms of how different incidents are handled and have contact information for all parties engaged as part of the support process. 

![IncidentResponsePlan](https://github.com/alvarovitta/Management-and-Operations-/blob/master/_images/IncidentResponsePlan.png)

NOTE: The MIRP does not negate the need for the broader Incident Management process; instead it provides highly efficient plan of attack into the existing process, specifically for the most critical situations. 

 

### Key Elements of MIRP 

Roles and responsibilities: 

Summary of the different Microsoft and customer roles & responsibilities, so that anyone leveraging the MIRP has a clear understanding of who does what. 

Stakeholder contact information: 

Identify who to communicate with. Include all relevant customer and Microsoft stakeholders, as well as their title, phone numbers, email address, and role. 

For Premier customers the MIRP should also include the customer contact Premier Access IDs 

Examples of roles to include in communication plan: 

Customer: IT Manager, Messaging, Identity or Networking IT Manager, CIO, Vendor/Outsource contacts, and other roles as needed (including partners). 

Microsoft: Account Executive, Account Technology Strategist, Technical Account Manager (for Premier), Support Practice Manager (for Premier) 

Crucial communications plan: 

Agreed upon contact methods and frequency for major incidents 

Cloud subscription/tenant info: 

List of Azure subscription IDs, as well as a brief description of each 

Support Request instructions: 

Full details of how to log a Support Request to Microsoft, so that this information is readily available in the MIRP and doesn't require searching online or elsewhere for instructions 

Also include severity level definitions such that anyone reading MIRP immediately understands appropriate severity for a given issue being logged 

Business impact statement guidelines: 

Best practice/guidelines for what to include in a Support Request to ensure an effective business impact statement 


### Premier Customers 

For Premier customers, you should discuss the MIRP process with your Technical Account Manager (TAM). The TAM will assist in establishing the MIRP document leveraging an existing & recommended template.
