Use the procedure described in this section to establish and maintain a Major Incident Response Plan (MIRP) for Azure. Once this capability is in place, your organization will have a readily accessible and up-to-date playbook detailing the key stakeholders, communication steps, and support logistics with Microsoft in the event of a business-critical incident related to your Azure services. 

 

## Preparation 

Perform the following activities before you being the Major Incident Response Plan authoring process: 

 

Premier customers 

Ask your Microsoft Technical Account Manager to schedule the MIRP creation activity with you 

Ensure all appropriate stakeholders will be available for MIRP creation activity 

Work with your Microsoft Technical Account Manager to ensure appropriate stakeholders are set up to log Support Requests through the Azure Portal 

Non-Premier customers 

Request the MIRP template from your Microsoft account team 

 

## Procedure - How to Create a Major Incident Response Plan 

Use this procedure to create the Major Incident Response Plan document. 

 

Premier customers should simply work with their Microsoft Technical Account Manager through the activity - i.e. no need to manually go through the info below. 

 

1. Complete the 'Roles and Responsibilities' section 

<TODO - Do we manually list all the fields, or simply include the MIRP template as an attachment or external link?> 

 

2. Complete the 'Tenant/Subscription Key Information' section 

<TODO - Do we manually list all the fields, or simply include the MIRP template as an attachment or external link?> 

 

3. Complete the 'How to Open a Service Request' section 

<TODO - Do we manually list all the fields, or simply include the MIRP template as an attachment or external link?> 

 

4. Complete the 'Template/Workflow' section 

<TODO - Do we manually list all the fields, or simply include the MIRP template as an attachment or external link?> 

 

5. Store/communicate MIRP document 

Store the completed MIRP document in a formal and accessible internal location 

Review the MIRP document with all affected stakeholders 

 

## Next Steps 

After you create the Major Incident Response Plan, proceed to conduct the same exercise for the Cybersecurity Major Incident Response Plan: Security Incident Response Plan 

## Overview 

A Major Incident is a service incident with disastrous impact (either existing or potential), for example: 

 
- Significant financial loss 
- Regulatory non-compliance 
- Legal ramifications 
- Physical harm 
- Brand/reputational damage 
 

NOTE: Security incidents are categorized separately, and covered in the 'Security Incident Management' section. 
 

### The Major Incident Process 

The primary inputs & outputs of the Major Incident process are depicted as follows (emphasizing the importance of maintaining visibility into the health of your applications and Azure subscriptions):

At the time of a major incident, two of the most important elements to focus on are: 

Fast resolution of incident (Time-to-Restore) 

Communication of impact and expected duration to stakeholders 

NOTE: This requires that you have an established communication plan, and ideally that you measure your communication effectiveness 

 

Key metrics to capture per major incident ("MI") include:
