## Overview 

Knowledge Management processes focus on the management of current, legacy and preview knowledge and driving the organization to become "knowledge based". Users have a shrinking tolerance for things not working properly and/or being confusing. When they encounter a question or work stoppage, they want to get the information to resolve the issue and return to productivity quickly, without having to leave the context of the activity they were performing. The expectation is that the knowledge management system is aware of the user’s context and can provide relevant targeted information based on the environment. 

 

### The Modern Approach 

Modern knowledge management is role and context aware filtered and sorted based on relevance to the consuming user with embedded opportunities to provide feedback on relevance. Modern knowledge management also merges and integrates multiple information sources together providing a curated experience across external (public) content, internal organizational content (provisioning processes, environmental outage notices, etc.), tool / component specific content (such as known defects) and community based resources (discussion forums, social media, etc.). This curated information is available across multiple consumption methods (device types, embedded within UIs, in a Knowledge Management tool, search, etc.) 

 

BizDevOps teams will embed knowledge in code (app/infra) and in the release pipeline for a certain project.
