## Overview 

Service Operations help make sure that each cloud service continuously meets requirements defined from Service Delivery. Organizations define each of these components as standardized processes, but specific application of the processes often varies across services. Management and Support components support the components of this subdomain. Automation is recommended for many of these processes to drive agility and quality while minimizing human error and cost. 

 

## Policy as the Foundation 

The foundation for governance rests upon corporate and IT policies - For example human resources, audit assurance/compliance, risk management, identity & access management, business continuity management, and so on. 
 

Delivery of cloud-based solutions requires a flexible governance model. A key question in establishing operational processes for cloud is Why and how the existing corporate & IT policies need to be changed in the new world, for example: 


  - What corporate policies break when you adopt Azure? 
  - What can you do now to get in front of this change? 
  - How does this impact your business model? 


As such, establishing a cloud service operations model requires that policies be evaluated and possibly modified. 

 

## Processes as the Implementation 

Processes are required to deliver and operate the different cloud services according to the agreed upon SLAs. Cloud-enabled processes are highly automated touching technology, functionality, and ITSM activities. The cloud-enabled operational processes can generally be broken down into 8 categories: 

 - Request Fulfillment 
 - Access Management 
 - Asset and Configuration Management 
 - Systems Administration 
 - Change Management 
 - Knowledge Management 
 - Release and Deployment Management 
 - Incident and Problem Management 

 

The following sub-sections dive into each of these categories. 


Would like to discuss the relationship between the diagram in 1. Cloud Management Capabilities with this one.

I understand that some of the structure for the document was  borrowed from this model. There are definitely synergies
