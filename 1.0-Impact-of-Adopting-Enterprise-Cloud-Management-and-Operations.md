## Overview 

As you complete the foundational setup of the Azure Cloud Platform, you will become more proficient designing, configuring cloud components (i.e., environments, applications and infrastructure resources) to the extent that you will be able to start deploying production business systems. You have materialized the initial value that the Azure Cloud Platform can provide to your organization which is access to infrastructure resources on demand. However, the way you manage and operate your cloud from this point in time will determine the path that you will take in your cloud journey: 

- The effective and organized path could result in the validation of the cloud business case and make your Azure Cloud the platform of choice 

- The careless management path could result in the next version of expensive hosting for your organization discouraging the adoption of public cloud in your organization. This is irrespective of the Public Cloud platform you are using. 

The objective of this document is to provide the necessary guidance for the management and operation of the Azure Cloud Platform applying the necessary structure and discipline while still leveraging the benefits of the cloud: Agility, Scale and High Quality.  

## Design Principles & Considerations 

 

Once you have reached the foundational readiness in the Azure Cloud Platform a new set of requirements and trade-offs will organically originate as part of your cloud journey. This include: 

 
- Business executive leadership and Enterprise IT will start encouraging Line of business and application teams to leverage the Azure Cloud Platform as much as possible. This is due in part to the expectations set as part of the enterprise cloud business case. As a result, your cloud demand pipeline will grow rapidly 

- Azure Cloud Platform foundational readiness has impacted the technology portion of the entire transformation. However, the people and process portions should catch up with this new technology enablement 

- For the sake of velocity, you will be tempted to turn over your current Data Centre management and operations practices adopt them to manage the Azure Cloud Platform as a way to draw near your people and process portions of the operation. Avoid this practice at any cost. The Azure Cloud platform is like an empty canvas that can be reshaped itself into becoming another traditional data centre with a higher cost undermining your Public Cloud business case with the business and executive leadership 

- Architecture teams with little to no exposure to a cloud model will review application design in the Public Cloud through the wrong lens. Cloud architects face the same challenge when the size of the Azure Cloud footprint reaches a certain size. On average, cloud architects could spend up to 6 months reviewing application designs for the cloud undermining the key capabilities of cloud and the reason for its adoption 

- Due to the velocity inherited in the Azure Cloud Platform, it is challenging to maintain adherence to organizational guidelines and best practices resulting in an increase amount of effort spent on collecting, analyzing and presenting results, insights and trends, and again, diminishing the value of the Azure Cloud Platform  

 

## Proven Practices 

 

To achieve a successful enterprise adoption of the Azure Cloud Platform you need to work on building the following capabilities in your organization: 

 

### Cloud Management 

 

Cloud management entails the collection of knowledge, processes and platform capabilities that you can use to govern, configure, monitor, protect and/or secure the Azure Cloud Platform. Most of these capabilities can be found as built-in capabilities in the Azure Cloud Platform or can developed by your cloud teams (i.e., Infrastructure as Code) based on your specific cloud management requirements. This is all possible due to the consistent Azure Cloud Platform management layer design and structure. At the core of this management layer the Azure Cloud Platform provides the following components: 

 

- The Azure Resource Manager (ARM) as the core broker or enabler of resources in the Azure Cloud Platform 

- The Azure Service Management API which enables direct access to the ARM broker via the Azure Portal, Command Line commands or Scripts (Coding) 

- The Azure Resource Providers which is the offering resources and operations available in the Azure Cloud Platform 

 

This modular, flexible and scalable design empowers you with a breadth and depth of tools, methods and practices that you can adopt for a successful operation of the Azure Cloud Platform at Enterprise scale 

 

### Cloud Service Delivery & Operations 

 

As one of the key promises of adopting cloud at any scale, including at the enterprise level, is the delivery of faster flows of technology streams, traditional IT service management practices can't be used as the service model for the azure cloud platform unless it is transform and adapted to embrace all the benefits the cloud can provide to the organization. The fundamental transformation of your service management model should be focus on the disintermediation. The role of technology in the organization now will focus on two main areas: 

 

- To the business the technology organization take the role of partner and enabler of business solutions with emphasis on the business and customer value of the products and services the organization provides 

 

- To the technology capabilities the technology organization take the role of a capability or resource broker rather than a custodian. The technology organization will embrace and encourage self-service, knowledge management and automation. The focus will be on end-to-end solutions and not technology sub-areas 

 

For these reasons, the entire service management model should be transformed in order to incorporate the Azure Cloud Platform. We acknowledge that the transformation of the entire service management model can happen immediately. As a result, this document will focus on the key areas required for you to enable the Azure Cloud Platform in your organization as effective as possible. This set of recommendations and proven practices comes from the collective experience of working with enterprise clients around the glove in their cloud transformation journey. However, this is by no means a full blown reference guide to Service Management transformation. For more information on that specific topic, please refer to <reference>.
