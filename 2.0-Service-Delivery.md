This section needs to cover the broad topic of Service Level Agreement (SLA) - maybe in the 'Service Level and Lifecycle' sub-section? 

 

# BRAINSTORM (SLA): 

- [Azure SLAs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/) 
- Understanding Azure SLAs vs customer's service provider SLAs 
- End-to-end SLAs need to provide meaningful SLA measurements that are relevant to the Business 
  - To be successful, each critical supporting component must be evaluated beforehand to have confidence the SLA can be achieved, based on that component's SLA 
  - The end-to-end service, and the critical components (whether insourced or outsourced), to be tracked and reported on an ongoing basis 
- Service end-to-end availability is the result of the individual availability of each component involved 

## Sample elements of the SLA (VERBOSE) 

1. Name of the IT Service  
2. Contact people  
  - Name of the Service Provider 
  - Name of the Service recipient 
  - Contact partners/ persons in charge (on client-side and on the side of the IT Organization) for

      - Contract start 
      - Contract end

      - Rules for termination of the SLA 
4. Service description 
  - Short description of Service 
  - Users of the IT Service on the client-side 
  - Breakdown of the offered Service into Service groups, e.g. along infrastructure components or IT applications 
  - For each Service group: 
      - Which Services are offered, e.g.: 
        - Handling of Service interruptions (by telephone, by remote access, on site?) 
        - User Services (user administration, installation, …) 
      - What quality is required of the offered Services, e.g. 
        - Service times 
        - Availability requirements 
        - Performance requirements 
        - Requirements for the maintenance of the Service in the event of a disaster
