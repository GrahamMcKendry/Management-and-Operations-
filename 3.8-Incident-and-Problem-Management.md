## Overview 

Incident and Problem Management (IPM) for Azure is a vital service operation process as it impacts business continuity, which in turn impacts user confidence in services offered as well as the success of service adoption & usage. As with many service operations for Azure, IPM processes involve shared responsibility between Microsoft and the cloud customer. The customer service provider plays an important role both in communications/actions with Microsoft, and communications/actions with the customer service consumer. 

 

IPM is broadly defined by to process areas: 

 

1. Incident Management Process - Which itself covers three subcategories 

- How normal incidents are handled at varying levels of technical support workflow 
- How major incidents are managed 
- How security incidents are managed 

2. Problem Management Process - Collaborative reactive and proactive problem analysis, review, data collection and recommendations across all service components, thereby reducing incident 
volumes 

 

## Azure Service Incident Notifications 

Azure offers two primary notification channels for service incidents: 

 

The [Azure Status webpage](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/status/#current) provides near-real-time status ("Good", "Warning", "Error", "Information") of Azure services by datacenter region. The webpage also provides an RSS feed as well as a 90-day history. As such, the Azure Status webpage can act as an informal incident notification or status verification mechanism, however would not be considered the primary/sole source of information in a formal enterprise Incident Management framework. 

The [Service Health blade/dashboard](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Health/AzureHealthBrowseBlade/serviceIssues) within the Azure Portal provides more robust integration into your existing Incident Management platform & processes, including: 

Service issues impacting your specific Azure subscriptions & resources 

Targeted health alerts - via emails, text messages, and webhook notifications 

Resolution guidance and support 

 

Additional details are available at https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/service-health-overview 

 

Note: The processes outlined in this page focus on the scenario where Microsoft is your 1st-party cloud Support provider. If your primary Support provider for Azure is a separate Cloud Service Provider or Managed Services Provider, additional consideration must be made regarding tweaks to the outlined processes. 

 

## Incident Management Process Details 

1. BEFORE: 

Create Major Incident Response Plan (MIRP): Refer to 'Major Incident Response Plan' 

Configure service health alerts: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-activity-log-alerts-on-service-notifications 

[If applicable] Configure integration to 3rd-party Operations Platforms (e.g. ServiceNow, PagerDuty, OpsGenie): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-health/service-health-alert-webhook-guide 

[If beneficial beyond health alerts] Subscribe appropriate stakeholders/roles to Azure Status webpage RSS: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/status/feed/ 

2. DURING: 

Create incident in internal Incident Management system: 

At a minimum for problem tickets generated from service consumers 

Potentially also for health alert notifications from Microsoft - even if service consumers haven't reported issues yet - depending on whether your Incident Management system covers "potential" incidents 

Monitor health status through preferred channels (Azure Status webpage, Azure Portal, Azure service health alerts) 

Update incident status in internal Incident Management system 

Optionally (and recommended if not leveraging webhook integration) can include direct link in Incident Management system to Azure service health status in Azure portal, or alternatively can export PDF summary of health status from Azure portal and attach in Incident Management system 

For major incidents, leverage MIRP: Refer to 'Major Incident Response Plan' 

If incident causing business impact for your services, report via Microsoft Support: See below for 'Problem Management Process Details' 

3. AFTER: 

[If applicable] Review Post-Incident Review (PIR): Refer to 'Incident Follow-Up' 

[If applicable] Submit SLA credit request: Refer to 'Incident Follow-Up' 

 

## Problem Management Process Details 

NOTE: A problem might be reported by the customer service consumers or by the customer service provider before or after Microsoft identifies an Azure service incident. 

 

1. BEFORE: 

[Premier customers] Premier subscription matching: Work with your Microsoft Technical Account Manager to ensure that the relevant Azure subscriptions are enabled for Microsoft Premier Support - Otherwise any Support cases logged against those subscriptions will be routed to Microsoft's Professional Support queue and will not benefit from the managed service aspects of Premier Support. 

Enable/train appropriate staff to log cases to Microsoft Support: 

[Premier customers] Reach out to your Microsoft Technical Account Manager to ensure that each staff member who will be responsible for logging Support requests to Microsoft is enabled for case submission and is aware of the key elements of the Premier Support process (e.g. case submission channel, severity levels, problem categories, typical requested information, etc). 

[Non-Premier customers] Ensure that each staff member who will be responsible for logging Support requests to Microsoft understands the steps for submitting requests through the 'Support' blade within the Azure portal 

2. DURING: 

Create incident in internal Incident Management system 

Submit Support ticket: Azure customers can & should submit problem tickets via Support requests when a problem with a service is believed to be related to Azure. Refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request 

Collaborate with Microsoft and other parties as needed: Problematic symptoms with Azure services may be related to various root causes, including Azure issues, network issues, client-side issues, and so on. As with existing on-prem problem management processes, initial stages of issue clarification and troubleshooting may involve multiple parties, and as the root-cause is narrowed down, the scope of parties involved may decrease. 

NOTE: Collaboration with Microsoft Support is typically by way of email, phone and screen-sharing sessions. 

Update problem status in internal Incident Management System 

3. AFTER: 

[If applicable] Apply improvements: Cascade insights from problem resolution as appropriate, into: 

Service Delivery (e.g. Business Continuity) 

Service Operations (e.g. Knowledge Management) 

Service Management & support (e.g. Configuration Management, Orchestration, Security, etc.) 

 

 

 

**DRAFT - MODIFIED FORMAT/TEMPLATE**

 

Incident and Problem Management 

Use the procedures described in this section to implement the appropriate processes for managing Azure service incidents and technical problems related to Azure. Once these processes are in place, your Monitoring, Incident and Service Desk teams will be equipped to manage planned and unplanned outages/changes to services that rely upon Azure. 

 

Preparation 

Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks: 

Create an Azure Major Incident Response Plan: Major Incident Response Plan 

Create (or update) a Cybersecurity Major Incident Response Plan: Security Incident Response Plan 

Configure/subscribe to Azure service health alerts via the following avenues: 

RECOMMENDED - Activity Log alerts:  Create activity log alerts on service notifications 

OPTIONAL (if you leverage a 3rd-party Operations Platform) - Webhook integration: Configure health notifications for existing problem management systems using a webhook 

OPTIONAL (if you leverage a 3rd-party ITSM tool) - ITSM Connector for Azure: Connect Azure to ITSM tools using IT Service Management Connector 

OPTIONAL (if you require a more programmatic approach beyond Activity Log alerts) - ARM templates & PowerShell: Set up Azure Service Health Alerts programmatically using PowerShell 

OPTIONAL (if you require an RSS feed) - Azure Status webpage RSS: Azure Status RSS 

If you have a Microsoft Premier Support contract: 

Ensure your Azure subscriptions are enabled for Premier Support: Reach out to your Microsoft Technical Account Manager 

Ensure appropriate staff members are enabled to log Premier Support cases: Reach out to your Microsoft Technical Account Manager 

On an ongoing basis, monitor Azure health status via the avenues outlined above in Step 3. 

 

Procedure - How to Manage Azure Service Incidents and Problems 

Use this procedure to manage Azure Service Incidents and Azure-related technical problems that impact or may impact your organization. 

 

1. Create Incident in your internal Incident Management System 

Specifically for issues that are relevant to the Azure services you leverage - Not for every Azure service incident that Microsoft publishes 

Webhook integration or ITSM Connector for Azure may allow for Azure service health alerts to automatically create a new incident in your Incident Management / ITSM system 

May also create new incident in your internal Incident Management System for issues discovered by users or service desk or IT/Ops, that are not yet confirmed by Microsoft to be Azure service incidents 

 

2. Collaborate with Microsoft Support 

Create Support ticket with Microsoft: How to create an Azure support request 

Note: Premier customers should select 'Premier' as the Support Plan 

 

3. Update Incident status in your internal Incident Management System 

On an as needed basis, monitor Azure health status via the avenues outlined in the 'Preparation' section 

Webhook integration or ITSM Connector for Azure may allow for Azure service health alerts to automatically update existing incident in your Incident Management / ITSM system 

Upon issue resolution, close incident in your internal Incident Management System 

 

4. If the issue was rooted in Azure, complete Post-Incident Steps 

If you require root-cause details of the Azure Service Incident, obtain the Post-Incident Report: Incident Follow-Up 

If the issue impacted your Business and violated the SLA of the particular Azure Service, submit a service credit request: Incident Follow-Up 

 

Next Steps 

After you implement the Incident and Problem Management processes, incorporate any new learnings into existing knowledge: Knowledge Management 

 

 

 

 

 

ADDITIONAL INFO (TBD whether to re-include it) 

 

The Modern Approach 

Incident resolution is driven to the end user so that the incident can be recovered without extending time-to-resolution and without engaging IT human resources 
endlessly. Major incident management takes a metrics-based approach, balancing speed of resolution with efficiency of the bridge. Problem management ensures a 
collaborative approach involving multiple teams responsible for operations, infrastructure, applications and the business - Not only to identify primary issues from a 
service, but also to leverage data insights to improve overall service availability and quality.
