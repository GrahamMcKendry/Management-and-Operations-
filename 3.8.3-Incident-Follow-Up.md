Use the procedures described in this section to implement the appropriate processes for follow-up actions related to Azure service incidents. Once these processes are in place, your Incident Management team will be equipped to obtain/understand the details of business-impacting Azure service incidents, and if applicable request a financial credit. 

 

## Preparation 

Perform the following activities before you begin the procedure tasks: 

Premier customers: Work with your Microsoft Technical Account Manager to ensure appropriate stakeholders are set up to log Support Requests through the Azure Portal 

Bookmark and review the Service Level Agreement definitions for the Azure services you use, through one of the three following resources: 

SLAs for individual Azure services: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/ 

SLA summary for all of Azure: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/support/legal/sla/summary/ 

SLA for all Microsoft Online services: http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=37 

 

## Procedure - How to Follow Up with Microsoft After Azure Service Incidents 

Use this procedure to execute the relevant post-incident follow-up activities. 

 

1. Obtain the Post-Incident Review (PIR) 

Once Microsoft publishes the PIR (typically within 5 business days from the time of incident resolution, only for Azure service incidents that span multiple customers), obtain the PIR from one of two locations: 

Azure Status webpage (service-wide impacts): https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/status/history/ (only covers up to last 90 days) 

Azure Portal (subscription-specific impacts): Specifically the Azure Service Health blade 

Review the PIR to understand the incident summary, details, customer impact, incident start date/time, root cause, and next steps 

For more specific issues that impacted only your subscriptions/resources, if applicable request a root cause analysis via a Microsoft Support Request: [How to create an Azure support request](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request) 

 

2. Submit a Service Level Agreement credit claim 

For service incidents that violate their associated SLA and negatively impacted your business (and meet all other terms of the SLA credit process detailed in the SLA documentation), submit an SLA credit request via a Microsoft Support Request: [How to create an Azure support request](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-supportability/how-to-create-azure-support-request) 

 

## Next Steps 

After you establish the Incident Follow-Up processes, make sure to close the loop from a knowledge perspective by incorporating post-incident learnings into existing knowledge: Knowledge Management
