## Overview 

## Policy Lifecycle Management 

Due to the rapid rate of change inside the Azure Cloud Platform ecosystem, a healthy lifecycle management of all cloud policies is fundamental to maintain or increase the value it adds to the cloud governance process, as well as, instill adoption by the enterprise. It is a living lifecycle that requires constant revision so it can evolve to the changing requirements of the platform and the enterprise.  

For an effective definition and maintenance of your policy we recommended that, on a regular basis, facilitate the following conversations for each step in the lifecycle: 

**1. What drives your need for Policy in Cloud? Identify and rank your requirements for policy such as:** 

    - Regulatory compliance and Audits 
    - Financial controls 
    - Security  
    - Reliable performance 
    - Implementation and Enforcement of enterprise wide design standards 

**2. Who owns the policy definitions and implementation?** 

    - Office of the Chief Information Security Officer 
    - Central Cloud Engineering Team 
    - DevOps teams 
    - Security/Infrastructure Architects 
    - Business Owners 

**3. What is involved in defining a new policy or refine an existing one?**  

    - Evidence-based definition. i.e., direct security or financial impact 
    - What-if analysis 
    - Current State assessment 
    - Focus on non-compliant resources and groups 

**4. What is preventing you to achieve this workflow?** 

    - Scalability 
    - On-demand testing 
    - Discovery of configurations 
    - Compliance reporting 
    - Exception handling
