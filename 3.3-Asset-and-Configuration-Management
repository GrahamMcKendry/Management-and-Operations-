## Overview 

Asset & Configuration Management processes focus on how software and hardware assets that provide technical capabilities are management by the organization, from asset acquisition to retirement. All assets - also referred to as "Configuration Items" (CIs) - that enable services are managed by a component of Change Management, and changes to CIs impact the SLA for the service. 
Asset & Configuration Management processes also ensure that all CI data is up-to-date and that deviation from known state is managed. 
Service Management and Change Management and all other processes use the data from Asset & Configuration Management to add details to their processes. 

 

Note: Financial IT Asset Management is an overlapping but separate discipline; the focus for this section is on service dependency. 

 

## The Modern Approach 

Automated population and reconciliation with inherent service dependency which incorporates both CIs (logical, virtual, non-financial) and assets. Proactive configuration is based on dynamic discovery utilizing a cloud service based approach, rather than building services based on components.

### Key Questions to Get Started 

- What data sources are used for your Asset and Configuration Management database/processes? 
- Are all assets/CIs contained in the CMDB linked to services? 
- Have you defined retention periods set for the different instances within a workload? 
- If yes, what are the retention policies? 
- How is configuration compliance (configuration drift) tracked, managed, and enforced? 

 

### Asset & Configuration Management Processes 

At a high-level the key processes to establish for asset & configuration management are as follows: 

- Data Source Management processes: 
  - Synchronize Data sources 
  - Detect and Remove Orphan Resources 
- Retention processes: 
  - Update Retention Periods 
  - Check On Retention Periods 
- Asset and Configuration Management processes: 
  - Add New Items to CMDB 
  - Update Configuration in CMDB 
  - Remote Item from CMDB 
  - Configuration Compliance Check
