## Overview 

Request Fulfillment processes focus on how (non-incident) consumer requests are fulfilled. This includes requests for administration, information, support, and various services. The request fulfillment processes define requirements of how the Consumer Portal, Deployment, Provisioning, and Fabric Management integrate to fulfill requests. They also define how the infrastructure, platform and software technical capabilities integrate. As request fulfillment is consumer-facing, it is a key enabler to meeting the customer expectation and user satisfaction. 

 

### The Modern Approach 

Highly automated with limited human involvement for most requests. Human involvement is required when automated decision processing cannot be utilized or does not exist. Fulfillment resources are focused on assisting service consumers to use portal and self-service functionality.

### Key Questions to Get Started 

- What kind of component services will be provided by the service provider? 
- What kind of bundled services will be provided by the service provider? 
- Are lifecycle policies established for both component and bundled services? 
- What will be operated by the service provider for the different component services and bundled services? 

 

### Request Fulfillment Processes 

At a high-level the key processes to establish for request fulfillment are as follows: 

- Component Service Management processes: 
  - Publish Component Service to Service Catalog 
  - Archive Component Service from Service Catalog 
  - Deprecate Component Service from Service Catalog 
  - Assign Component Service to Tenant(s) / Workload(s) 
- Bundled Service Management processes: 
  - Publish Bundled Service to Service Catalog 
  - Archive Bundled Service from Service Catalog 
  - Update Bundled Service within Service Catalog 
  - Assign Bundled Service to Tenant(s) / Workload(s)
