## Overview 

Release and Deployment Management processes focus on how approved changes are tested and deployed to production without impacting operations. Proper release and deployment management expects batching, integration, system and performance testing of changes to occur. It includes the validation that the changes, once released, have not impacted operations (mitigates the risk to operations), and provides a confirmation to the change process once the entire process is complete. 

 

Automation, reuse and speed are expected - this set of processes is one of the most significant changes in a cloud-based environment.
