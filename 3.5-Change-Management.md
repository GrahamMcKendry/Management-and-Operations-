## Overview 

Change Management processes focus on monitoring, communicating and reacting to continuous changes, resulting from Release Pipelines. This focus - as opposed to focusing on change control and delay - stems from the cloud principle that changes are smaller in scope and impact but much greater in number. 

 

### The Modern Approach 

Smaller changes driven by Release Pipeline where change schedules are known, mitigation and risk controls (e.g. no standing rights in target environment, automated deployments, automated mandatory testing, mandatory approvals, etc) are engineered into the change operations and support is provided by the same team involved in engineering the change.
