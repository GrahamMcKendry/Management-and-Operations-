## Overview 

As soon as you complete your Enrollment and Subscription Management **(ADD URL TO ENROLLMENT AND SUBSCRIPTION)**, your enterprise is ready to start getting the benefits of the cloud including Agility, Volume and Scale. As mentioned in section 5. Resource Policies & Locks **(ADD URL TO ENROLLMENT AND SUBSCRIPTION --> Resource Policy section)**, you have the capability to start defining resource policy definitions to provide an initial level of governance to your Azure setup.  

However, not so long after your initial setup, account owners and service administrators will increase the usage of the Azure Cloud Platform by enabling new resources to the business or technology areas servicing the business. Enterprises will start seeing an increased number of subscriptions trying to onboard hundreds, if not thousands, of applications (i.e., workloads) to the Azure Cloud Platform. 

This demands for an Enterprise Approach for Cloud Governance. 

## Design Principles & Considerations 

 

### Central Cloud Engineering Role 

The demand to govern the cloud platform from an enterprise perspective will require the creation of a new set of roles that are aligned to a new Central IT function that operates as an enabler of resources in this new cloud ecosystem. We have identified these groups in several organizations as: 

 

Central Cloud Engineering Teams 

Group of Cloud Custodians 

Cloud Asset Management Teams 

 

These Role, or group, should be accountable to provide all 5 core Cloud Governance Capabilities mentioned below: 

### Cloud Governance Capabilities 

To achieve a Governance model that works for the enterprise cloud, we have identified five specific capabilities that are required to operate effectively in an enterprise cloud setup:  

Policy-based Management: Assess and enforce enterprise-wide governing standards across your cloud environment for proper control and compliance 

Resource Visibility: Quickly search and find resources across your organization and their relationships with query-based exploration 

Subscription Governance: Create easy-to-use pre-defined templates for teams that meet organizational security and compliance requirements 

Cost Management: Monitor cloud spend, drive organizational accountability 

Usage Optimization: Optimize cloud efficiency to create a solid and living value case to the cloud 

 

### Control with Agility 

These Central Cloud Role will grow organically with the objective of managing or containing cloud resource sprawl that is not aligned with the business or unable to traceback to a customer or business value stream. One benefit of cloud governance is that cloud offers the alternative of visibility and control without losing the agility and scale. This should be the fundamental principle behind your governance practice.  

 

## Proven Practices 

 

### Central Cloud Engineering Team - Roles 

 

Although the scope of the Central Cloud Engineering Team should include all 5 Cloud Governance Capabilities described above, the responsibilities and volume of work with increase over time. As a result, we recommend to evolve the cloud governance operating model based on the following staff structure and accountabilities: 

 

### Foundational Cloud Management Structure 

 

A foundational structure is suitable for Enterprises in which enrollment and subscription management has been defined for the first time and a limited amount of resources have been activated in Azure. As a result, we can group the Cloud Capabilities to be managed by two members of the team: 

| __Cloud Governance Role__ | __Capabilities__ |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Policy Manager   | Policy-based Management, Resource Visibility, Subscription Governance  | 
| Cost Manager     | Cost Management, Usage Optimization | 


### Advanced Cloud Management Structure (Preferred) 

As the total number of resources managed in the cloud grow, the Central Cloud Engineering team can do a more detail segregation of duties. The advanced model suggest one person assigned for each governance capability.

| __Cloud Governance Role__ | __Capabilities__ |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Policy Manager   | Policy-based Management  | 
| Cloud Asset Manager     | Resource Visibility | 
| Cloud Operations Manager   | Subscription Governance  | 
| Cost Manager     | Cost Management | 
| Optimization Manager     | Usage Optimization | 


## Preparation 

(Need to validate if this content is relevant for the RBAC for Governance. Will discuss with the team) 

For each account ensure a valid Azure Active Directory account exists and is associated with a monitored mailbox.  Enrollment and account notifications will be sent to email addresses specified with the mailbox of the Azure Active Directory account. 

If a different email address is needed to activate the enrollment request a new identity be added by submitting a request here. 

### Cloud Management Structure 

| __Field__ | __Value__ |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|
| Cloud Governance Role Name   | <___@tenant.onmicrosoft.com>   | 
| Azure Active Directory Credentials   | <___@tenant.onmicrosoft.com>  |
