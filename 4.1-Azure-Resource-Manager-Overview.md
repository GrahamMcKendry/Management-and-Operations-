[MA] This topic seems to fit under the automation narrative. I will leave it here, but harvest the content here: Azure Resource Manager 

 

[GA] I don't need this section anymore here so feel free to leverage it or discard it

It is important to highlight that the entire Azure Governance and Operations is possible due the Azure Resource Manager (ARM). This is a deeper level from the 0.x section
